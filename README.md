Functions and mixins for a starter project

## functions

Convert functions between px, em, rems

I usually use a big settings map with all global variables and use functions to get colors, breakpoints and such, so I need something to get me variables deeper in the map.

## mixins

Simple breakpoint and size functions. Obviously need some more stuff in there
